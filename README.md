# Tokonatsu's Safe Guarding and Anti-Harassment Policies
We at Tokonatsu recognise the need of an easily accessible, safe, and inclusive
environment for all our attendees, volunteers, employees, and third parties. To
ensure that our policies and processes are fully accessible we have published
them in this open repository.

## Our Aim
Beyond ensuring that all the documentation is accessible, we would like to
share our policies so that they can be used by any person or company that are
comfortable with the information that Tokonatsu has produced, but also enable
anyone to contribute to the policies and text. Many people within Tokonatsu
have worked on these policies, and while we have attempted to cover all
possible areas, there might be something you will be able to add to it. 

## Contributing
You can find details on contributing through the [contribution file](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## The Documentation
*Work in progress - while we copy our policies into this repo, some documentation maybe missing*!
