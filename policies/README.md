# Safeguarding and Anti-Harassment
The safety of children, vulnerable adults, and all attendees are a top priority for Tokonatsu. Thus, it is a mandatory requirement for running our event that we have a Safeguarding Policy in place, and visible to the general public. This will be made up of the following details:

* [The Anti-Harassment Policy (Public Version)](safegarding-policy.md)
  * This can be split into small versions or a specific version generated if required
* [The Safeguarding Incident Procedure](safeguarding-incident-procedure.md)
* [Named Safeguarding Offices (SGOs)](safeguarding-officers.md)
  * Will require a mixed group of people for accessibility
  * A minimum of 2 in each category
* Proof of completion of a minimum of a Level 2 Safeguarding certificate from a certified source
* At least 2 senior volunteers who have attained the Level 3 Safeguarding Certificate
* A yearly documented audit of the above details

While Tokonatsu hopes to never enact the policy, we want to ensure that Tokonatsu is a safe, accessible space for all our attendees.
