## Knowing who are the Safeguarding Officers
Located on the Tokonatsu website, as well as a mention during the Opening Ceremony of the event should be the names of the current Safeguarding Officers. Both lists must be kept up to date as and when Safeguarding officers are trained and certified.

During the event, all staff members and volunteer roles must know who the Safeguarding officers are, in order to direct attendees to the correct people to talk to regarding Safeguarding issues. 

## Reporting an Incident
* If an attendee comes to you with a Safeguarding concern and you are not a Safeguarding Officer, calmly mention to the attendee that you will take them to someone who will be able to assist. 
  * If the attendee provides you with details regarding the incident, please treat it with the utmost secrecy as it will be a very personal affair to the attendee.
  * Do not ask any questions that can be considered leading. This may include but doesn't limit to questions such as "Did person x do [named activity here] to you?" as this may alter the attendee's story. 
  * When directing someone to a Safeguarding Officer, provide them with the choice on who to go to. Some people feel more comfortable dealing with certain groups of people over others.
  * If you are unable to easily locate a Safeguarding Officer in your general area, Radio in and ask for an officer by name instead of a group calling.
    * This makes sure that only one Safeguarding Officer comes to your location or another location instead of all of them.
  * If you are able to, stay with the Safeguarding Officer as a partial party.
* If an attendee comes to you with a Safeguarding concern and you are a Safeguarding Officer, make sure that both parties have a second person to act as a partial person.
  * If the incident is considered serious, and you only have Level 2 Training, mention to the attendee that this incident will be escalated to someone with Level 3 Training to follow up and finish the report.

* If possible, when asking questions to not ask any questions that lead the attendee down a certain route of thought. Make sure the questions are open as possible and allow the attendee to direct the depth of response.
* Make sure the information is collected in a way and method that you will be able to read from or recall when passing the information onto another Safeguarding officer or another party (e.g. Police, Safeguarding Board for Adults / Children for the local council)
